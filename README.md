## Time Management
This application is for users who want to strive at multiple categories of commitments, while keeping a list of actionables that can be easily completed within an approximate time period. This application advocates for a skill to break up commitments into small actionable items at the planning stage, and prioritize action items that need to be completed at an earlier time.
